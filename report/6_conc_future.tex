\section{Future Work}
Although this is the first attempt at classifying Pashto poetry, with no existing dataset, our project still has some limitations. 

Firstly, the dataset is imbalanced, and has a varied distribution. We have collected multiple other pashto poetry books, and we plan to add them to the dataset to make it more balanced. We are aiming for about 30 poets, with a dataset size of at least 35000 couplets. Additionally, we will try to collect more data from poets already in the dataset to make the distribution more uniform. Once the data has been collected, we will study the distribution again, and set a threshold for the minimum number of couplets a poet should have in the dataset. We will then remove the poets that do not meet this threshold. Moreover, we will also set a threshold for the maximum number of couplets a poet should have in the dataset, to avoid overfitting on the data of a single poet. Those poets will then be subject to custom train-test splitting, where the data that crosses the maximum threshold will be used for testing only, thus ensuring that the model does not overfit on the data of a single poet. Furthermore, we will experiment more with the models we have already used, and other models that we have not used, and also experiment with varying hyperparameters and features, in order to improve the performance of the models.
